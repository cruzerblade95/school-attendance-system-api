### Project Name
`Student Attendance System Using QR code`


### Problem statement
In the traditional way, there are different methods to get a student's attendance. Teachers could ask about a student's name, or he can pass a paper between students and make them assign next to their names or univ. ID.
But unfortunately, all of these methods took a lot of time, in some cases, it took more than 15 minutes, so this can be considered as one of the limitations of the learning process.
As well, the teacher could lose the papers or some-how it can be destroyed, so it's not the best way to do this operation.

### Solution Proposal
By analyzing student's facial features such as eyes direction, mouth states, chin position, eyebrows and many other features, we can calculate the student's attention.
The idea is to ask the student to open his web/mobile camera during online session (Required a device with a camera).
And start monitoring his attention by analyzing facial features that will be used to calculate the student's attention. The system will generate reports to course teacher based on student performance.
